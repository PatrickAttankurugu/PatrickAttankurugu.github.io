            <h1>Transition from Chemistry to Computer Science: A Journey into AI</h1>

            <p>Just a few years ago, I was a Chemistry major at the University of Ghana. Today, I'm a burgeoning AI engineer, passionately delving into the intricacies of machine learning, data science, and computer vision. The journey hasn't been easy, but it's been tremendously fulfilling. In this blog post, I want to share my journey, the resources that helped me, and why I believe anyone, regardless of their academic background, can venture into the world of Data Science and AI.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">The Unexpected Pivot</h2>

            <p>In September 2017, I started my college education as a Chemistry major. Like many students, I had interests spanning various fields, but the allure of scientific discovery had led me towards Chemistry. After a semester, however, I realized that my passion didn't lie in test tubes and periodic tables. I wanted to create, build, and solve complex problems. And so, I started exploring.</p>

            <p>I discovered a book titled "The Gift In You" by Dr. Caroline Leaf. This book opened my eyes to the vast potential within me and encouraged me to leverage my innate abilities and interests. Driven by this new insight, I decided to make a leap from Chemistry to Computer Science. This decision didn't come lightly, as it meant repeating a year, but I was determined to pursue a path that resonated with me.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Stumbling Upon Data Science</h2>

            <p>As I was delving into Computer Science, I had a serendipitous encounter. A friend mentioned a data science opportunity with a company that was willing to sponsor his education and subsequent employment. But there was a catch – the field required a love for programming and math, two things my friend didn’t care much for. Sensing an opportunity, I started researching more about Data Science.</p>

            <p>I spent countless hours on platforms like Quora and Reddit, reading about data science from experts in the field. Figures like Monica Rogati, LinkedIn's first data scientist, provided invaluable insights. These platforms offered a wealth of information that helped me grasp the potential and breadth of this burgeoning field.</p>

            <p>Armed with a newfound passion for data science, I reached out to professionals on LinkedIn, seeking mentorship and guidance. One of them, Yvette Kondoh, was gracious enough to take me under her wing. Yvette provided not only technical guidance but also navigational advice in this new and exciting field.</p>

            <p>Through my journey, I realized that my love for problem-solving and creation found a perfect outlet in data science. But I also found myself leaning more towards the engineering side of things, and that's when I discovered AI.</p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">The Shift Towards AI</h2>

            <p>As I immersed myself in Data Science, I stumbled upon a field that combined my love for problem-solving and engineering – Artificial Intelligence. AI, with its blend of math, programming, and real-world problem-solving, felt like the perfect fit. So, I started diving deeper into this exciting field.</p>

            <p>Despite its complexities, AI was not out of reach. I started with online courses on platforms like Udemy. These platforms made learning accessible and flexible, allowing me to balance my university studies with my self-guided exploration into AI. I applied my learning in real-time, undertaking projects that challenged and honed my understanding of AI.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">The Journey Continues</h2>

            <p>Today, my journey from a Chemistry student to an aspiring AI engineer is a testament to the power of passion, curiosity, and persistence. It is a journey of constant learning, relearning, and problem-solving. Each day brings new challenges, but also new opportunities for discovery and growth.</p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Your AI Journey</h2>

            <p>If you're reading this and wondering if you can also venture into Data Science or AI, I'm here to tell you – yes, you can! No matter your background, if you have an interest in solving complex problems and a passion for learning, you can start your journey in Data Science and AI.</p>

            <p>Starting might seem daunting, but remember, every expert was once a beginner. There are plenty of resources available, free and paid, that can guide you through this journey. Online platforms, communities, and mentors are there to help you navigate this exciting field.</p>

            <p>The world of AI and data science awaits you. It's a world filled with challenges, but also with incredible opportunities for growth, learning, and making a real-world impact. So take that first step, ignite your passion, and let your journey into AI begin!</p>
            
            <p>I hope my journey can serve as an inspiration and guide to you as you embark on your own path into the world of AI. Happy coding!</p>
